Summarize the technical aspects of the Library editor.

## Editor responsibilities
### Summary
The Library of Defense Editor delivers training and educational content for Oregon's public defense practitioners that is timely, relevant, well-organized and publicized to the public defense community and subscribers.

### Content management
The Library Editor oversees content creation using the popular WordPress and MediaWiki platforms and curates the Library's Collections, Legislative Updates, Criminal Appellate Reviews, Blog, Local Pages, Videos and OCDLA's flagship Books Online product. The Editor manages access to these resources in terms of subscription tiers and is responsible for identifying groups of users who should benefit from the various content offered in the Library.

### Subscription management
Subscribers can be managed using OCDLA's cloud Salesforce CRM, which stores identify information (name, email address and username) and, optionally, profile information (e.g., areas of expertise/interest, profile picture).  Subscribers manage their own logins to the Library and Books Online, especially their usernames and passwords, using OCDLA's already-functioning Salesforce Single Sign-On facilities.

### Outreach
Outreach to consumers of Library content can be communicated using existing mass email, SMS or listserv facilities already running on the OCDLA platform.  These modes can be used to inform subscribers of new content, relevant content (i.e., by area of interest) and new application features that further the practice of public defense practitioners.  Messages can be automated, scheduled or generated on an ad-hoc basis.
